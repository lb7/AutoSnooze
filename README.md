# AutoSnooze

AutoSnooze is a work-in-progress alarm application for Android devices designed to alleviate the problem of setting multiple alarms for each day or needing to snooze multiple times. Once feature complete, users will be able to specify the number of times they'd like each alarm to repeat and the interval between each repeat.

The app is essentially functional at this point, however there is still a lot of fine tuning to be done especially with the UI design.

I make use of some third party libraries such as Realm for my alarm database and Butterknife for view binding. RxJava is used a little bit but it's just some trivial stuff to familarize myself with how it works at this point.

The [release apk](https://github.com/lb7/AutoSnooze/blob/master/app/app-release.apk) can currently be installed on Android API 16 and above.
