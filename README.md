# AutoSnooze

AutoSnooze is a work-in-progress alarm application for Android devices designed to alleviate the problem of setting multiple alarms for each day or needing to snooze multiple times. Once feature complete, users will be able to specify the number of times they'd like each alarm to repeat and the interval between each repeat. 

Note: At this point the AutoSnooze portion of AutoSnooze isn't implemented, as well as some of the finer UI details. It does function as a fully working alarm clock however.

The [release apk](https://github.com/lb7/AutoSnooze/blob/master/app/app-release.apk) can currently be installed on Android API 17 and above.
